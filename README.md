# Sales_Prediction
This project aims to predict sales for a given dataset using machine learning techniques in Python. It includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and performance evaluation. The goal is to forecast future sales based on historical data, which can help businesses make informed decisions.

## Technologies Used
Python: The main programming language used in this project.<br>
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.<br>
NumPy: For numerical operations.<br>
Scikit-learn: For machine learning models and evaluation metrics.<br>
XGBoost: For advanced gradient boosting models that improve predictive performance.<br>
Matplotlib and Seaborn: For data visualization.

## Models and Techniques
The following models were explored for sales prediction:<br>

Linear Regression: A basic regression technique for predicting continuous values.<br>
Random Forest Regressor: A more complex model using an ensemble of decision trees.<br>
XGBoost: A gradient boosting method for improved performance.<br>
Each model was tuned using GridSearchCV to find the best hyperparameters, and evaluated based on Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R-squared (R²).

## Evaluation Metrics
The models are evaluated using the following metrics:<br>

Mean Absolute Error (MAE): Measures the average magnitude of the errors in a set of predictions.<br>
R-squared (R²): A statistical measure of the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables.
